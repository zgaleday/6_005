     * Ensure the rep invariant is maintained.
     * Test constructor only allows new Books to be created that follow preconditions.
     * 
     * Ensure that getTitle returns correct title.
     * Ensure that getYear returns the correct year.
     * Ensure that the list of Authors is not mutated when passed to the object. Ensure that order is maintained.
     * Ensure that mutating the list from getAuthors does not effect the rep. (no rep exposure)
